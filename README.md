# IsThereACubsGameToday
is a Chrome Extension to answer the simple question for Chicago residents near Wrigleyville - is there a cubs game today that will mess with traffic?  It started because I found myself constantly going to the website isthereacubsgametoday.com - so made a way for that to always be visible.  That website used to have an API, but it has since changed, so the data is coming from different sources.  As a bridge to people that cared about baseball, I also added in 'fan mode', which adds real-time score and game status info; this functionality was later branched into the separate Baseball Tracker extension.

NOTE: This extension is deprecated - the functionaltiy has been rolled into Baseball Tracker, and this extension is no longer actively in development.
